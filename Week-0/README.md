**Compiler Explorer Tool**
1. Compiler Explorer, also known as godbolt.org, is an online tool for analyzing assembly output generated by 
 compilers.
2. It allows developers to explore how high-level code translates into low-level assembly instructions.
3. Useful for understanding compiler behavior, optimizing code, and comparing compiler output.

**RISC-V Assembly Instructions**

RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing - V) is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on a simplified and modular design. It has different instruction formats, and assembly language instructions are represented by various opcodes. Below are some common RISC-V assembly instructions, along with brief explanations:
    **Arithmetic and Logical Instructions:**
        ADD rd, rs1, rs2: Adds the values in registers rs1 and rs2 and stores the result in register rd.
        SUB rd, rs1, rs2: Subtracts the value in register rs2 from rs1 and stores the result in register rd.
        AND rd, rs1, rs2: Bitwise AND of the values in registers rs1 and rs2, storing the result in register rd.
        OR rd, rs1, rs2: Bitwise OR of the values in registers rs1 and rs2, storing the result in register rd.
        XOR rd, rs1, rs2: Bitwise XOR of the values in registers rs1 and rs2, storing the result in register rd.

    **Data Transfer Instructions:**
        LW rd, offset(rs1): Loads a 32-bit word from memory at the address (rs1 + offset) and stores it in register rd.
        SW rs2, offset(rs1): Stores the value in register rs2 to memory at the address (rs1 + offset).

    **Control Flow Instructions:**
        JAL rd, offset: Jumps to the address (PC + offset) and stores the return address (PC + 4) in register rd.
        JALR rd, rs1, offset: Jumps to the address (rs1 + offset) and stores the return address (PC + 4) in register rd.
        BEQ rs1, rs2, offset: Branches to the address (PC + offset) if the values in registers rs1 and rs2 are equal.

    **Immediate Instructions:**
        ADDI rd, rs1, imm: Adds the immediate value imm to the value in register rs1 and stores the result in register rd.
        LUI rd, imm: Loads the immediate value imm into the upper 20 bits of register rd.

    **Comparison Instructions:**
        SLT rd, rs1, rs2: Sets rd to 1 if the value in register rs1 is less than rs2; otherwise, sets rd to 0.
        SLTI rd, rs1, imm: Sets rd to 1 if the value in register rs1 is less than the immediate value imm; otherwise, sets rd to 0.
