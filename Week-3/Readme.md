# Wearable Health Monitoring Device

## Project Overview:
Design and build a wearable health monitoring device that can measure heart rate and body temperature. 
The device will be compact, lightweight, and capable of providing real-time data monitoring. It will be controlled by a microcontroller and display the measurements on a small screen or via a connected mobile application.

Components Needed:
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Nano or ESP32)
Heart rate sensor module (e.g., MAX30102 or PulseSensor)
Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35 or DS18B20)
OLED display or LCD display
Battery for power
Straps or casing for wearable integration
Connecting wires and soldering equipment
Optional: Bluetooth module for wireless connectivity to a smartphone app
