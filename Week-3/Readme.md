# Wearable Health Monitoring Device

## Project Overview:

Abstract:
This C program, designed for wearable health monitoring, accepts input from a temperature sensor. The input data consists of four boolean values representing temperature readings. Each boolean value corresponds to a sensor output, capturing different aspects of temperature. The program's output is directed to a seven-segment display, where the temperature value is visually represented. This implementation underscores the seamless integration of input from a temperature sensor into a compact wearable device, culminating in a clear and concise visual display of temperature information on the seven-segment interface.
### Components Needed:
1. RISCV Microcontroller with Required I/O
2. Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35 or DS18B20)
3. 4 bit ADC
4. 7 segments or LCD display
5. Battery for power.
