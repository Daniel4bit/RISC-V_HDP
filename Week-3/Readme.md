# Wearable Health Monitoring Device

## Project Overview:
Design and build a wearable health monitoring device that can measure heart rate and body temperature. 
The device will be compact, lightweight, and capable of providing real-time data monitoring. It will be controlled by a microcontroller and display the measurements on a small screen or via a connected mobile application.

### Components Needed:
1. RISCV Microcontroller with Required I/O
2. Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35 or DS18B20)
4. 7 segments or LCD display
5. Battery for power.
6. Buzzer.
